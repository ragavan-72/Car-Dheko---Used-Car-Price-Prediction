# Car-Dheko---Used-Car-Price-Prediction

This project based on regression problem soliving, by this project we can learned and practice in many regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, 
Gradient Boosting Machines and more
we used more pithone and used cuple of CSS code to deploy the Streamlit app. we trained and evloved the models by Train-Test Split: Common split ratios are 70-30 or 80-20. 
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search, Performance Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared.
with this kind of skill we have deplyed intractive streamlit app and accurate price prediction.

Results: 
A functional and accurate machine learning model for predicting used car prices.
Comprehensive analysis and visualizations of the dataset.
Detailed documentation explaining the methodology, models, and results.
An interactive Streamlit application for real-time price predictions based on user input.

Project Scope:
We have historical data on used car prices from CarDekho, including various features such as make, model, year, fuel type, transmission type, 
and other relevant attributes from different cities. Your task as a data scientist is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately 
predict the prices of used cars based on these features. 
The model should be integrated into a Streamlit-based web application to allow users to input car details and receive an estimated price instantly.
